## What I hope to Learn!

I hope to learn a lot more about geospatial analysis and how to create customizable maps. I really enjoyed the basic GIS class and used a number of my GIS skills in my summer internship as a researcher for #JustRecovery which is a study on the impact of COVID19 on margionalized communities in Toronto, Pittsburgh, and Atlanta. I was on the Toronto team.
